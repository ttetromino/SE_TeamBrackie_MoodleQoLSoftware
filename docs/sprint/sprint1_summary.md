# Sprint 1 Summary
For the first session of the sprint, the team worked on User Story 1 (Login Feature) for 6 hours, completing two task tickets for the database and one for the login page. T-01 is still waiting for review from a QA, while T-02 is still in development. In total, session 1 worked on all task tickets. 

There are a lot of challenges that our team encountered during our first session. First, one of our members is not fully present in our 6-hour session due to personal obligations in their household. This introduced a problem of waiting for the QA to come back and review the pushed code, slowing down our progress. To momentarily fix this, one of our members acted as a temporary QA. The second issue is that our developers are not fully familiar with the git workflow, causing merging and pushing problems. Though it is fully reversible, we had to spend our first hour learning how merging and pushing work with different branches.

For the next sprint, the team is expected to have overcome the issues raised in the first session; all our members should be present during our session hours, and all our developers must be knowledgeable in git.
