# GitFlow Branch Strategy
According to GeeksForGeeks (2026), GitFlow enables parallel development, allowing developers to work separately on feature branches. 

***Our team will be using four different kind of branches***:

- **Master/Main Branch**: Used for product release
- **Develop Branch**: Used for ongoing development
- **Feature Branches**: Created from the develop branch to work on specific features.
- **Hotfix Branches**: Created from the master branch to address urgent issues directly in production. 

We will not be utilizing a hotfix branch due to the nature of this project while making it more simple for us.
